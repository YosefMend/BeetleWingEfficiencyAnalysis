# BeetleWingEfficiencyAnalysis
This repository contains the code and data for a comprehensive analysis of the flight efficiency and elasticity of beetle wings conducted as part of a university project in collaboration with the Biomechanics of Animal Locomotion Laboratory and the School of Mechanical Engineering. The project explores the biomechanical properties of beetle wings through data analysis techniques, shedding light on their aerodynamic performance and structural resilience. The repository includes Matlab scripts for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization, along with a comprehensive proposal detailing the methodology and findings of the study.
